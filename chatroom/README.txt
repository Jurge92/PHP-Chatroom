I ran the program in Chrome and got every function working.

Sometimes, there are something strange happening. The SVG content won’t load. I have no idea why this happens, it happens occasionally and seemingly at random times. If I wait for a while or reload the page multiple times, it starts working again. Maybe it has something to do with the server program (XAMPP), but really I have no idea. Seems to happen if the user triggers an error, like not providing a name on login. It’s really annoying, because I cannot seem to find a way around it. It just fixes itself after a while.

When you click on a color, and then send a message, it will send the message in that color. If you do not click on any color, it will by default send the message in black.

Upon login, the system will check for all the requirements listed in the project assignment. If something is not correct, an alert will be shown. However, the user can in most cases continue to login, as it isn’t a requirement to actually stop the user, but just show an alert.

The user can select a picture upon login, I also added an alert if a picture is not chosen. In addition I added a preview of the image, so the user may see the picture he want to upload.

The logout works as described, shows a button, and returns to the login page. No mention of actually removing the user from the database, so the user will continue to stay in the database, as it was not a requirement.

Both the colors and hypertext are working. This was quite a hassle, but no matter where you put the link in the message, the message will become a hypertext which you can click and will open a new window with the url.

The online user works and displays the photos and names of all the users. I did a different design as I liked it more. 

Every functions works for me (Chrome V47, OS X El Capitan), so please let me know if something is not working at your computer.
